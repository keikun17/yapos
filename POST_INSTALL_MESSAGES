Capistrano 3.1 has some breaking changes. Please check the CHANGELOG: http://goo.gl/SxB0lr

If you're upgrading Capistrano from 2.x, we recommend to read the upgrade guide: http://goo.gl/4536kB

The `deploy:restart` hook for passenger applications is now in a separate gem called capistrano-passenger.  Just add it to your Gemfile and require it in your Capfile.

Post-install message from yard:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of YARD v0.9.2:

RubyGems "--document=yri,yard" hooks are now supported. You can auto-configure
YARD to automatically build the yri index for installed gems by typing:

    $ yard config --gem-install-yri

See `yard config --help` for more information on RubyGems install hooks.

You can also add the following to your .gemspec to have YARD document your gem
on install:

    spec.metadata["yard.run"] = "yri" # use "yard" to build full HTML docs.


==============================
Post-install message from i18n:

HEADS UP! i18n 1.1 changed fallbacks to exclude default locale.
But that may break your application.

Please check your Rails app for 'config.i18n.fallbacks = true'.
If you're using I18n (>= 1.1.0) and Rails (< 5.2.2), this should be
'config.i18n.fallbacks = [I18n.default_locale]'.
If not, fallbacks will be broken in your app by I18n 1.1.x.

For more info see:
https://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n/releases/tag/v1.1.0

Post-install message from sass:

Ruby Sass has reached end-of-life and should no longer be used.

* If you use Sass as a command-line tool, we recommend using Dart Sass, the new
  primary implementation: https://sass-lang.com/install

* If you use Sass as a plug-in for a Ruby web framework, we recommend using the
  sassc gem: https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby#readme

* For more details, please refer to the Sass blog:
